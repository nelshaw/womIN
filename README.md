# Inspiration ‚ú®
One of the biggest challenges women+ face is building up the courage to break into STEM. We believe that the most valuable resource one could offer is mentorship and the ability to develop a network of like-minded individuals as well as key resources. Current general resources available to all individuals include mock interview platforms, social media networking applications, and various online conferences.

However, we wanted to create an all-in-one web application that specifically connects and encourages women+ to break into STEM together. As a group of women+ in STEM, we know how daunting the path of STEM can be so our goal was to create a safe and comfortable platform specifically for women+! Our web application connects female and non-binary mentors and mentees through a matching algorithm, enables women+ to share interview experiences and includes a personal dashboard to track current job applications to help mentees kickstart their careers.

# What it does ü§î
Wom[In] has 3 main features:

Network Recommendations. Our platform is designed to pair female and non-binary mentors and mentees with each other based off of similar interests, past experiences and current interests. Being surrounded by like-minded successful individuals is key to success as learning from them would be invaluable.

Company Reviews. We also wanted to integrate a company review feature into our application. We wanted a user to be able to search by company and find a list of other user testimonials regarding the interview process (number of rounds, interview nature (technical/behavioural/OA), useful resources & topics to study).

Personal Job Dashboard. This feature would give the user the ability to track which companies they submitted an application for, the stage of the process, etc. Ideally, we would have been able to add a feature function for better usability.

# How we built it ‚öíÔ∏è
Our application was built using a React frontend and Node.js + Express.js backend. We also setup a login and authentication feature and stored this user information and job application information into a MongoDB database. We also registered the domain womin.tech to host our project in the future!
